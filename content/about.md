My name is Francisco, also known as "gunzf0x". I am a professional astronomer that also loves hacking stuff.

I started exploiting [HackTheBox (HTB)](https://www.hackthebox.com/) machines and, since then, I really enjoyed it; slowly entering into the hacking world...

I currently have done over +100 machines in the [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.com/) platform. 

I have more than 10 years of experience in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and 3 years with [Go](https://go.dev/).
