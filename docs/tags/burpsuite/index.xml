After an initial scan above TCP ports, they show the victim machine is running websites in 2 ports: 80 and 31337. Visiting the classical website on port 80 gives us a hint about the site on port 31337. Looking the source code of the second page shows some encoded text that gives a hint a bout a hidden file.</description></item><item><title>HTB FormulaX WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/formulax/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/formulax/</guid><description>FormulaX &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Hard Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading FormulaX is a Hard machine, based on Linux, from HackTheBox platform. After an initial scan, we see that the site is running a webpage. This webpage allows us to create a user. After creating it, we see that a &amp;ldquo;Contact Us&amp;rdquo; form is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS), which allows us to discover a new subdomain/virtual host.</description></item><item><title>Vulnhub Mr-Robot WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/mrrobot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/mrrobot/</guid><description>Mr-Robot &amp;ndash; Vulnhub Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: Vulnhub Summary Link to heading Mr-Robot is an easy and free Linux machine from Vulnhub. After an initial scan above TCP ports, they show the victim machine is running a website. This website is running on WordPress. Since Wordpress shows a different message when a user exists or not (even if we provide a wrong password), we can abuse this message error to search for valid users thanks to a previously found dictionary.</description></item><item><title>HTB Usage WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/usage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/usage/</guid><description>Usage &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Usage is an easy Linux machine from HackTheBox. After an initial scan above TCP ports, they show the victim machine is running a website. This website presents a simple login panel, where we are able to create an account and find a new subdomain for the site. There is an option for our created user to restart our password; nevertheless, this function is vulnerable to SQL Injection.</description></item><item><title>HTB IClean WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/iclean/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/iclean/</guid><description>IClean &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Medium Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading IClean is a medium Linux machine from HackTheBox. After an initial scan above TCP ports, they show the victim machine is running a website. This website presents a cleaning service. Among all the options available this site presents, we are able to request a service that is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS); which allows us to steal a cookie and perform a Session Hijacking attack.</description></item><item><title>HTB Headless WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/headless/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/headless/</guid><description>Headless &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Headless in an easy box from HackTheBox platform. From an initial scan we find that the target machine is running a webpage on port 5000 which is still on development. We see that this page has a form that we can fill. However, when we attempt some tricks the page detects &amp;ldquo;Hacking Attempts&amp;rdquo;. After analyzing it (and based on the machine name) we are able to inject XSS payloads through the header requests.</description></item><item><title>HTB Perfection WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/perfection/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/perfection/</guid><description>Perfection &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Perfection in an easy box from HackTheBox platform. Inside it we have a webpage that shows a calculator for Grades and their respective weights. Nevertheless, one of the fields inside this calculator allows command injection which allows us to gain access to the victim machine. Once inside, we note that our user belongs to the group sudo, so we only need to know its password to run any command as root.</description></item><item><title>HTB Pov WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/pov/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/pov/</guid><description>Pov &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Medium Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Pov is a medium Windows machine from HackTheBox. After performing sub-domains scans, we find a dev virtual host for the available webserver. This new site, that seems like a blog, allows us to download a portfolio PDF. Analyzing how the server provides this file, we find it uses View State. After some research, we use YSoSerial.</description></item><item><title>HTB Analysis WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/analysis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/analysis/</guid><description>Analysis &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Hard Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading We are able to find subdomains for the domain analysis.htb and multiple directories with tools like Gobuster and ffuf. Bruteforcing vulnerable parameters in one of these directories, we find that one is vulnerable to LDAP Injections. Through this vulnerability we find a user and a password that works for an admin panel. Inside this administration panel, we are allowed to upload a PHP webshell and enter in the machine.</description></item><item><title>HTB Napper WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/napper/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/napper/</guid><description>Napper &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Hard Platform: HackTheBox User Link to heading Nmap scan shows only 3 ports open: 80 HTTP, 443 HTTPs, 7680 an unknown service ❯ sudo nmap -sS --open -p- --min-rate=5000 -n -Pn -vvv 10.10.11.240 -oG allPorts Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.240 Host is up, received user-set (0.18s latency).
