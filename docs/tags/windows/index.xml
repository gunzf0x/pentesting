After inspecting the main webpage of the victim machine, we note it is vhosting a subdomain. This subdomain is running Dolibarr with default credentials. Once in, we are able to exploit the vulnerability CVE-2023-30253 and gain initial access to the victim machine. We are also able to find credentials for this service that are the same as another user in the system.</description></item><item><title>HTB SolarLab WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/solarlab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/solarlab/</guid><description>SolarLab &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Medium Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading SolarLab is a medium box/machine from HackTheBox platform. An anonymous login through SMB service leaks credentials for a login panel in the victim machine. In this new panel, we are allowed to generate PDF reports using ReportLab library. This library is vulnerable to CVE-2023-33733, which allows Remote Code Execution and lets us gain initial access to the target machine.</description></item><item><title>HTB Mailing WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/mailing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/mailing/</guid><description>Mailing &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Mailing is an easy box/machine from HackTheBox platform. After performing an initial scan with Nmap, we see that the server is running a webserver. We find a resource that is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion, which allows us to read a configuration file and extract a password for an email service. Abusing CVE-2024-21413, we send multiple malicious mails; with this we are able to get the NTLMv2 hash for one of the users that opens a malicious mail and crack its password.</description></item><item><title>HTB Jab WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/jab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/jab/</guid><description>Jab &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Medium Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Jab is a medium Windows machine from HackTheBox. From an initial port scan, we note that the target machine is running Jabber, a messaging service based on XMPP. We are able to create a new user within this messaging service and be able to extract potential users. We then attempt an AS-REP Roasting attack against these users, where we are able to obtain hashes for 3 of them.</description></item><item><title>HTB Office WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/office/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/office/</guid><description>Office &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Hard Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Office is a hard Windows machine from the platform HackTheBox.

Checking open TCP ports we note that this server is, in fact, a Minecraft server. Analyzing its version we note that it is running a vulnerable version of Log4J, which allows us to to execute the famous exploit Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) and gain a shell as svc_minecraft user.</description></item><item><title>HTB Pov WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/pov/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/pov/</guid><description>Pov &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Medium Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Pov is a medium Windows machine from HackTheBox. After performing sub-domains scans, we find a dev virtual host for the available webserver. This new site, that seems like a blog, allows us to download a portfolio PDF. Analyzing how the server provides this file, we find it uses View State. After some research, we use YSoSerial.</description></item><item><title>HTB Analysis WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/analysis/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/analysis/</guid><description>Analysis &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Hard Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading We are able to find subdomains for the domain analysis.htb and multiple directories with tools like Gobuster and ffuf. Bruteforcing vulnerable parameters in one of these directories, we find that one is vulnerable to LDAP Injections. Through this vulnerability we find a user and a password that works for an admin panel. Inside this administration panel, we are allowed to upload a PHP webshell and enter in the machine.</description></item><item><title>HTB Napper WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/napper/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/napper/</guid><description>Napper &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Hard Platform: HackTheBox User Link to heading Nmap scan shows only 3 ports open: 80 HTTP, 443 HTTPs, 7680 an unknown service
