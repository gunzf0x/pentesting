After an initial scan above TCP ports, they show the victim machine is running a website. This website is running on WordPress. Since Wordpress shows a different message when a user exists or not (even if we provide a wrong password), we can abuse this message error to search for valid users thanks to a previously found dictionary.</description></item><item><title>HTB Usage WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/usage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/usage/</guid><description>Usage &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Usage is an easy Linux machine from HackTheBox. After an initial scan above TCP ports, they show the victim machine is running a website. This website presents a simple login panel, where we are able to create an account and find a new subdomain for the site. There is an option for our created user to restart our password; nevertheless, this function is vulnerable to SQL Injection.</description></item><item><title>HTB Headless WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/headless/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/headless/</guid><description>Headless &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Headless in an easy box from HackTheBox platform. From an initial scan we find that the target machine is running a webpage on port 5000 which is still on development. We see that this page has a form that we can fill. However, when we attempt some tricks the page detects &amp;ldquo;Hacking Attempts&amp;rdquo;. After analyzing it (and based on the machine name) we are able to inject XSS payloads through the header requests.</description></item><item><title>HTB Perfection WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/perfection/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/perfection/</guid><description>Perfection &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Perfection in an easy box from HackTheBox platform. Inside it we have a webpage that shows a calculator for Grades and their respective weights. Nevertheless, one of the fields inside this calculator allows command injection which allows us to gain access to the victim machine. Once inside, we note that our user belongs to the group sudo, so we only need to know its password to run any command as root.</description></item><item><title>HTB Crafty WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/crafty/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/crafty/</guid><description>Crafty &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Crafty is an easy box/machine from HackTheBox platform that teaches how to abuse vulnerable Log4j versions in an old Minecraft server. Checking open TCP ports we note that this server is, in fact, a Minecraft server. Analyzing its version we note that it is running a vulnerable version of Log4J, which allows us to to execute the famous exploit Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) and gain a shell as svc_minecraft user.</description></item><item><title>HTB Bizness WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/bizness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/bizness/</guid><description>Bizness &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Bizness is an easy box/machine from HackTheBox. Through a simple scan for hidden directories we note that this server is running a vulnerable Apache OFBiz version that allows Remote Code Execution. Once inside the machine we can search for data inside files and, eventually, reach an encrypted password. Using these encrypted credentials, along with typical password dictionaries, we are able to find the root user password.</description></item></channel></rss>
