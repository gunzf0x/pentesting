After an initial inspection to a Samba exposed service, we are able to brute force credentials for a user in this service. Inside this service, we are able to get and decode data that leads into credentials for a Grav CMS administration panel. We then are able to use the vulnerability CVE-2024-28116 to execute commands remotely and gain initial access to the victim machine.</description></item><item><title>THL Bridgenton WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/bridgenton/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/bridgenton/</guid><description>Bridgenton &amp;ndash; TheHackersLabs Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: TheHackersLabs Summary Link to heading Bridgenton is an easy/medium box from TheHackersLabs platform. We see the victim machine is running a webpage that allow us to upload a file. After testing which file extension this page accepts, we find one that allows us to upload a malicious PHP file and gain initial access to the victim machine. Once inside, we are able to find an unusual with SUID permissions that allows us to pivot to another user in the system.</description></item><item><title>HTB Mailing WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/mailing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/mailing/</guid><description>Mailing &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Mailing is an easy box/machine from HackTheBox platform. After performing an initial scan with Nmap, we see that the server is running a webserver. We find a resource that is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion, which allows us to read a configuration file and extract a password for an email service. Abusing CVE-2024-21413, we send multiple malicious mails; with this we are able to get the NTLMv2 hash for one of the users that opens a malicious mail and crack its password.</description></item><item><title>Vulnhub Matrix 1 WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/matrix1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/matrix1/</guid><description>Matrix 1 &amp;ndash; Vulnhub Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: Vulnhub Summary Link to heading Matrix 1 is an easy and free Linux machine from Vulnhub pltform. After an initial scan above TCP ports, they show the victim machine is running websites in 2 ports: 80 and 31337. Visiting the classical website on port 80 gives us a hint about the site on port 31337. Looking the source code of the second page shows some encoded text that gives a hint a bout a hidden file.</description></item><item><title>Vulnhub Mr-Robot WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/mrrobot/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/mrrobot/</guid><description>Mr-Robot &amp;ndash; Vulnhub Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: Vulnhub Summary Link to heading Mr-Robot is an easy and free Linux machine from Vulnhub. After an initial scan above TCP ports, they show the victim machine is running a website. This website is running on WordPress. Since Wordpress shows a different message when a user exists or not (even if we provide a wrong password), we can abuse this message error to search for valid users thanks to a previously found dictionary.</description></item><item><title>HTB Usage WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/usage/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/usage/</guid><description>Usage &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Usage is an easy Linux machine from HackTheBox. After an initial scan above TCP ports, they show the victim machine is running a website. This website presents a simple login panel, where we are able to create an account and find a new subdomain for the site. There is an option for our created user to restart our password; nevertheless, this function is vulnerable to SQL Injection.</description></item><item><title>HTB Headless WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/headless/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/headless/</guid><description>Headless &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Headless in an easy box from HackTheBox platform. From an initial scan we find that the target machine is running a webpage on port 5000 which is still on development. We see that this page has a form that we can fill. However, when we attempt some tricks the page detects &amp;ldquo;Hacking Attempts&amp;rdquo;. After analyzing it (and based on the machine name) we are able to inject XSS payloads through the header requests.</description></item><item><title>HTB Perfection WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/perfection/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/perfection/</guid><description>Perfection &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Perfection in an easy box from HackTheBox platform. Inside it we have a webpage that shows a calculator for Grades and their respective weights. Nevertheless, one of the fields inside this calculator allows command injection which allows us to gain access to the victim machine. Once inside, we note that our user belongs to the group sudo, so we only need to know its password to run any command as root.</description></item><item><title>HTB Crafty WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/crafty/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/crafty/</guid><description>Crafty &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Crafty is an easy box/machine from HackTheBox platform that teaches how to abuse vulnerable Log4j versions in an old Minecraft server. Checking open TCP ports we note that this server is, in fact, a Minecraft server. Analyzing its version we note that it is running a vulnerable version of Log4J, which allows us to to execute the famous exploit Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) and gain a shell as svc_minecraft user.</description></item><item><title>HTB Bizness WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/bizness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/bizness/</guid><description>Bizness &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Bizness is an easy box/machine from HackTheBox. Through a simple scan for hidden directories we note that this server is running a vulnerable Apache OFBiz version that allows Remote Code Execution. Once inside the machine we can search for data inside files and, eventually, reach an encrypted password. Using these encrypted credentials, along with typical password dictionaries, we are able to find the root user password.</description></item></channel></rss>
