After an initial scan above TCP ports, they show the victim machine is running a website. This website presents a cleaning service. Among all the options available this site presents, we are able to request a service that is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS); which allows us to steal a cookie and perform a Session Hijacking attack.</description></item><item><title>HTB Headless WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/headless/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/headless/</guid><description>Headless &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading Headless in an easy box from HackTheBox platform. From an initial scan we find that the target machine is running a webpage on port 5000 which is still on development. We see that this page has a form that we can fill. However, when we attempt some tricks the page detects &amp;ldquo;Hacking Attempts&amp;rdquo;. After analyzing it (and based on the machine name) we are able to inject XSS payloads through the header requests.</description></item></channel></rss>
