After performing an initial scan to the victim machine, we note that it is running CUPS service and is using a slighlty outdated version of it. Following the steps presented a few days ago (at the time of writing) from this blog we are allowed to execute commands remotely in the victim machine, gaining initial access to it.</description></item><item><title>HTB SolarLab WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/solarlab/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/solarlab/</guid><description>SolarLab &amp;ndash; HackTheBox Link to heading OS: Windows Difficulty: Medium Platform: HackTheBox Summary Link to heading SolarLab is a medium box/machine from HackTheBox platform. An anonymous login through SMB service leaks credentials for a login panel in the victim machine. In this new panel, we are allowed to generate PDF reports using ReportLab library. This library is vulnerable to CVE-2023-33733, which allows Remote Code Execution and lets us gain initial access to the target machine.</description></item><item><title>THL Webos WriteUp</title><link>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/webos/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gunzf0x.github.io/pentesting/posts/webos/</guid><description>Webos &amp;ndash; TheHackersLabs Link to heading OS: Linux Difficulty: Easy Platform: TheHackersLabs Summary Link to heading &amp;ldquo;Webos&amp;rdquo; is an easy machine from TheHackersLabs platform. After an initial inspection to a Samba exposed service, we are able to brute force credentials for a user in this service. Inside this service, we are able to get and decode data that leads into credentials for a Grav CMS administration panel. We then are able to use the vulnerability CVE-2024-28116 to execute commands remotely and gain initial access to the victim machine.</description></item></channel></rss>
